	title = {The Agree Predictor: A Mechanism for Reducing Negative Branch History Interference},
	abstract = {Deeply pipelined, superscalar processors require accurate branch prediction to achieve high performance. Two-level branch predictors have been shown to achieve high prediction accuracy. It has also been shown that branch interference is a major contributor to the number of branches mispredicted by two-level predictors. This paper presents a new method to reduce the interference problem called agree prediction, which reduces the chance that two branches aliasing the same {PHT} entry will interfere negatively. We evaluate the performance of this scheme using full traces (both user and supervisor) of the {SPECintgfi} benchmarks. The result is a reduction in the misprediction rate of gee ranging from 8.62\% with a 64Kentry {PHT} up to 33.3\% with a {IK}-entry {PHT}.},

	abstract = {We present {MINOTAuR}, an open-source {RISC}-V core designed to be timing predictable, i.e. free of timing anomalies: this property enables a compositional timing analysis in a multicore context. {MINOTAuR} features speculative execution: thanks to a specific design of its pipeline, we formally prove that speculation does not break timing predictability while sensibly increasing performance. We propose architectural extensions that enable the use of a return address stack and of any cache replacement policy, which we implemented in the {MINOTAuR} core. We show that a trade-off can be found between the efficiency of these components and the overhead they incur on the die area consumption, and that using them yields a performance equivalent to that of the baseline {RISC}-V Ariane core, while also enforcing timing predictability.},

These systems communicate with the external environment in a timely fashion, and thus impose constraints on the execution time of programs. Estimating the {WCET} of a program ensures that these constraints are met. {WCET} analysis schemes typically model micro-architectural features in modern processors, such as pipeline and caches, to obtain tight estimates.},
