	title = {The Agree Predictor: A Mechanism for Reducing Negative Branch History Interference},
	abstract = {Deeply pipelined, superscalar processors require accurate branch prediction to achieve high performance. Two-level branch predictors have been shown to achieve high prediction accuracy. It has also been shown that branch interference is a major contributor to the number of branches mispredicted by two-level predictors. This paper presents a new method to reduce the interference problem called agree prediction, which reduces the chance that two branches aliasing the same {PHT} entry will interfere negatively. We evaluate the performance of this scheme using full traces (both user and supervisor) of the {SPECintgfi} benchmarks. The result is a reduction in the misprediction rate of gee ranging from 8.62\% with a 64Kentry {PHT} up to 33.3\% with a {IK}-entry {PHT}.},

We propose architectural extensions that enable the use of a return address stack and of any cache replacement policy, which we implemented in the {MINOTAuR} core. We show that a trade-off can be found between the efficiency of these components and the overhead they incur on the die area consumption, and that using them yields a performance equivalent to that of the baseline {RISC}-V Ariane core, while also enforcing timing predictability.},

By accurately predicting the branch direction (i.e.,whether the branch is taken or not taken), these techniques reduce the amount of time spent waiting for the branch direction to be determined. Branch target buffers, which store target addresses, help further improve the performance of conditional branches. Since interval arithmetic operations and interval software programs frequently execute conditional branches, they have the potential for significant performance improvements from accurate branch prediction and branch target buffers.",
